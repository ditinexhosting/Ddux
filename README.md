<h1 align="center"> Project Title - Readme.md HTML Template </h1>

<p align="center"> Intro - Boilerplate for Readme.md on Github </p>

<hr/>

<p> Describe you project -> I hate to always "reinvent" README.md on GitHub that is why I decided to make this Starter README.md template. Also I prefer HTML syntax because I use HTML every day and it has some extra features like center the elements. </p>
